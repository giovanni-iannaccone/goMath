# goMath
I started this project solely to learn the Go programming language. To begin, run the following command:
```
go run gomath.go
```
You can then input any mathematical expression using the +, -, *, /, % , ^ operators. The program follows the classic mathematical precedence system, but you can use parentheses to specify a different order. Save numbers for future use by assigning them to variables with the syntax variable_name = value
